<h1 id="heading">Photography</h1>
<p>I have always liked taking pictures. I love capturing nature like the mountains, the sea, the sky, and everything in between. Whenever I see something beautiful, I feel the need to save that moment and share it with others. My interest in photography started when I was young, using whatever camera I could find, even if it was just a simple phone. Over time, it became more than just a hobby for me.

Photography helps me slow down and appreciate the small details around me. Looking at nature brings such a peaceful, calming feeling that it makes me forget everything else for a moment. It makes me want to just relax and be present. Sometimes, when I look at a beautiful scene, it makes me want to go there immediately or travel to any similar magnificent place. I especially enjoy taking photos of sunsets, trees, waterfalls, and quiet landscapes. Sometimes I wait for the perfect lighting or angle because I want each photo to truly express the beauty I see. Most of my pictures are taken on my phone, and I like editing them slightly to bring out the colours naturally.
<br>
<br>
Taking photos makes me feel calm, creative, and connected to the world. When I share my pictures, I hope they make others smile or remind them of how beautiful nature really is. In the future, I want to improve my skills even more and explore new places to capture different landscapes and moments.</p>

<p>Here are some pictures to show the type of photography i take, although these are not the ones I took; Codepen doesn't allow to upload pictures so I'm using pictures from online.</p>
